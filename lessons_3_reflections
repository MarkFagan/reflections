When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
So Others push changes to collaborate on your project or start a file others can work with.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some other developer may have introduced changes that you may not want

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are like clone but used to copy a repository to another GitHub account.  Clone is to get a Github repository locally.  Branches are used locally so you changes and features development does not effect the main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
you can work offline and then synch up later

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using Pull Request on GitHub is a way to stage a branch to be reviewed by collaborators before merging with master

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Changes in a branch can be used to collaborate on before changes are merged with master.  A few more steps, but protects master or you breaking other folks.
Updating master directly is easier and can be done on small programs with few developers.
